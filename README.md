# Risk-Analytics-in-Lending
This project applies Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand loan default risks in the banking and financial sector. The objective is to analyze loan application data, identify risk factors, and develop insights to help financial institutions make better lending decisions.
Through statistical analysis and visualization, this study aims to minimize the risk of financial loss while ensuring that creditworthy customers are not denied loans.

#Understanding Credit and Risk Analytics

Credit is a crucial aspect of the financial system, enabling individuals and businesses to access funds for personal or professional use. Banks and financial institutions assess an applicant's creditworthiness using various factors, including credit history, income stability, and past repayment behavior. Risk analytics helps institutions minimize potential losses by identifying high-risk borrowers while ensuring that eligible customers receive timely financial support.

Credit scoring models, such as FICO and VantageScore, use statistical techniques and historical data to predict a borrower's ability to repay loans. By leveraging EDA, financial institutions can refine these models, leading to improved lending strategies and risk assessment.
